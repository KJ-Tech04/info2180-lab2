                <p>My interest in web development started during my first semester break, when I began experimenting with HTML and CSS for small personal projects. I didn’t know much at the time, but I was curious about how websites were built and styled. I played around with basic tags and layouts, trying to understand how each element worked. Even though I was just getting started, I found it exciting to see my ideas take shape on a screen.</p>
                <p>Later on, in my second semester, I took a course called Computers and Society, where I had to use HTML and CSS more formally. That experience deepened my curiosity and gave me a clearer sense of how web technologies fit into the bigger picture. Since then, I’ve been motivated to learn more not just how to build pages, but how to make them clean, functional, and visually appealing. This blog is part of that journey, and I’m excited to keep growing.</p>

                <h2>Building My First Blog Layout from Scratch</h2>

                <p>Creating this blog layout from scratch was a new kind of challenge for me. I had to think about both structure and style how to organize the content using HTML, and how to make it visually appealing with CSS. Learning about CSS Grid and Flexbox was especially eye-opening. It showed me how powerful layout tools can be when used properly. At first, I struggled with getting everything to line up the way I wanted, but once I understood how grid areas worked, things started to click.</p>
                <p>One of the most satisfying parts was seeing my name and quote styled in the header, with my image perfectly rounded using border-radius. It felt like I was building something real, not just practicing. I also enjoyed customizing the sidebar and writing my blog posts, it gave me a chance to reflect on my journey and share it in a creative way. This project reminded me that learning web development isn’t just about writing code, it’s about solving problems and expressing ideas through design.</p>
